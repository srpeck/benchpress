# About
![](favicon.ico)Benchpress is a CMS that works with pure static web hosting like GitHub Pages. It is a single page application, so the Markdown conversion ships with /, and further pages are loaded through client-side routing and AJAX.


## Features
- Write in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/), use #hash links for internal links
- Minimal:
    - Page layout and navigation in index.html
    - Theme in style.css
- Simple workflow:
    1. Push index.html, style.css, and index.md to any static web hosting provider (e.g., GitHub Pages)
    2. Edit Markdown files locally and upload, or edit directly on the host (e.g., using GitHub Pages 'Create new file here'/'Edit this file' in-browser editor)
